Create a static layout for the business card in a Unity scene called ARBusinessCard. We strongly suggest you sketch out your business card layout (as well as storyboarding its subsequent animation for task #2) before opening up Unity. Your layout must include:

* your name
* job title
* at least four links, in text or button form
    * email
    * website / github
    * twitter
    * linkedin
    * or any other link or social media you want to use to promote yourself

You can find logos / icons for your buttons [here](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/V3OJK6Hh7Ugd94slQqkANw).

Upload a screenshot of your business card layout, put the link in a text file named 0-layout, and submit the link to the form below.
